# LED Blink (ESP32)

A basic Arduino project to blink an LED using GPIO 23 on the ESP32 board.

## 🔧 Hardware Used
- ESP32 board
- 1x LED
- 220Ω resistor
- Breadboard & jumper wires

## 💡 How It Works
The LED is connected to GPIO 23. The code turns the LED ON for 1 second and then OFF for 1 second in a continuous loop using `digitalWrite()` and `delay()`.
